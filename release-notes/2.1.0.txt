FIXED:

- Avoid partially resolving secure PMS host names. An upcoming release will reintroduce secure PMS host name resolution to improve PMS connectivity when offline or on networks which prevents DNS rebinding.
- UI: Pressing on the Home button in the header no longer reloads the application.
- UI: Selecting Go To Artist from a track in the music player no longer navigates to the version 1 view.
