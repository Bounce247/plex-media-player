FIXED:

- Ignore OS notifications when files are dropped onto the PMP window during drag and drop actions.
- Work around Windows' media-key handling which sends multiple input notifications for Play/Pause and Next key presses.
- Speculative fix for user reported trouble pressing Up and Down on silver Apple IR remotes when using a Mac Mini running High Sierra.
